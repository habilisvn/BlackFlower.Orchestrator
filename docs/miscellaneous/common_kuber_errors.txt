#1: Kibana server internal error
-> delete kibana pod

#2: Logstash monitoring
-> logstash is able to self monitor

#3: Kafka advertised host
-> The brokers advertise themselves using advertised.listeners, abstracted as KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME in the Docker image. Clients will connect to these advertised hosts and ports.
Ensure the client can resolve and access these advertised hostnames, such as by adding "kafka" to the client's /etc/hosts file.
